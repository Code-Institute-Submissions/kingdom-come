# Kingdom Come

PROMO IMAGE HERE

This is intended to be a destination website for County Kerry in Ireland, aka The Kingdom. It sets out to promote the five main towns around the county, using images, relevant information, mapping of key locations and glowing testimonials from visitors and other interested parties.

The idea is that the website will entice readers to want to 'come to the Kingdom', while also offering them an initial glimpse at the attractions they can see, the places they can stay and where they can eat.

There are many prospects for progressive enhancement of the website in the future, which are outlined later in this document.

## UX

This website should allow users to view the core information about all five towns within just a couple of clicks/taps and with minimal scrolling.

It needed to be a dynamic page, where clicking the name of each town from the navbar (dropdown burger menu on mobile) automatically changes all the content at the same time.

The initial website concept is that it will display 'top level' details about the towns, i.e. a hero image, the 'three things' oval-shaped images featuring key places and attractions, a map containing markers for the best hotels, restaurants and places to go (sourced from TripAdvisor), plus quotes aimed at whetting the appetite of people who are intending to visit.

So as a starting point for visitors to Kerry, this site tells them - if you're coming to the Kingdom, you should try staying at one of these hotels, eating at these restaurants and visiting these attractions.

## Features

### Existing features

* The navigation menu and other website features use the green and gold colours associated with County Kerry, which makes the site recognisable and familiar.
* The navbar and dropdown burger menu show options to click for each of the five main towns, which are neatly presented in alphabetical order.
* The landing page has an attractive hero image when each town is clicked. The default is Dingle, which is first alphabetically, but is also fitting to be at the forefront because of the beautiful image of the Dingle Peninsula.
* The 'three things' oval-shaped images are desgined to further entice the user with a glimpse at some of the main things each town/area has to offer.
* The 'bouncing arrow' map link at the bottom of the landing page is a call to action for the website user to see that there is more content further down. It is also clickable and uses an anchor link.
